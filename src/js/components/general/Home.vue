                                        <br />I guess we have most (if not all) heroes. Not all images though, but
                                        still.

                                        Specialty changed versions. E.g.: Lorina will have a link for Commander Lorina,

                                        <br />Fixed the image sizing. At first, I left to browser decide the size after
                                        image downloaded, but on older phones, the repaint/reflow after each image
                                        downloads is too slow so some heroes were stacking on one another for a few
                                        seconds until browser recalculated the sizes and fixed itself. Should be more
                                        performant now.

                                        <br />Some heroes we did at the start of project had different data structure
                                        (they'll be fixed) so I fixed the code to support both types. That means,
                                        Cecilia's Skill Enhancements now appear - just the names - as well as there
                                        shouldn't have any more Relationship issues that end up being an error page.
                                        Only heroes we have data on will be shown. So, for example, as this news' time,
                                        we don't have data on any of Cecilia relations, so the section will not show
                                        until we get data (e.g. Yufine, Nemunas, etc)

                                        <br />I think I fixed all typos (like <strong>22th</strong> to
                                        <strong>22nd</strong>) and others. Let me know if I missed any

                                        <br />Implemented placeholder images for artifacts that we do not have their
                                        images. That means you'll see a SD Ras and Arky on artifact's icons/small/full
                                        images which are missing. Thank you, wife for the edits :P

                                        <br />Example Artifact missing icon:

                                        <img

                                        <strong>API Caching</strong>
                                        <br />Implemented caching to the API calls for the list. This is also a
                                        preparation to make Heroes list perform better, and also to the list filters.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />That means it'll hit the API only once per user session, meaning anytime
                                        you hit <a class href="/artifacts"> <strong>Artifacts</strong> </a>&nbsp;link
                                        after the first time, it'll instantly load because I cached the first time's
                                        response. For you, it's a little less bandwidth used. Hopefully your browser
                                        cached the images :)

                                <a class href="/artifacts"> <strong>Artifacts</strong> </a>. Unfortunately we do not
                                have ALL images of all artifacts, so you might notice some missing icons or full arts.

                                <br />We are currently using a free account of Heroku and mLabs for the API and
                                Database, while the website hosting itself is on a paid host. Therefore, the website
                                might not have downtimes, but the backend might see some downtime if we reach the free
                                quota. Please report any issue you find when browser the website on our
